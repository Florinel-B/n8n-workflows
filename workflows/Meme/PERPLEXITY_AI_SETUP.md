## What is Perplexity AI?

Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that:
- Searches the web in real-time
- Understands context and nuance
- Provides sourced, accurate information
- Has API access for automation

### Pricing

- **Free Tier**: 5 searches/day (not enough for automation)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month - 300 searches/day (recommended)
- **API Pricing**: $0.005 per search (economical for 3/day)

**For this workflow**: ~90 searches/month = **$0.45-5/month** depending on plan

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get Perplexity API Key (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Perplexity AI**
   - Visit: https://www.perplexity.ai/
   - Click "Sign Up" if you don't have an account

2. **Subscribe to Pro or API Access**
   - **Option A**: Pro Plan ($20/month) - includes API access
   - **Option B**: API-only ($0.005/search) - pay as you go

3. **Get Your API Key**
   - Go to: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
   - Click "Generate New API Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `pplx-`)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Save it securely, you can't see it again!

4. **Test Your API Key**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer pplx-YOUR-KEY-HERE" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online",
       "messages": [
         {"role": "user", "content": "What are the top 3 trending tech topics today?"}
       ]
     }'
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Heroku Environment Variables (2 minutes)

Add the Perplexity API key to your Heroku config:

```bash
# Set Perplexity API key
heroku config:set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-key-here

# Verify it's set
heroku config:get PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
```

**Or via Heroku Dashboard:**
1. Go to your app settings
2. Click "Reveal Config Vars"
3. Add: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` = `pplx-your-key-here`

### Step 3: Update PostgreSQL Schema (3 minutes)

The Perplexity workflow needs a new database table to track AI-generated ideas:

```bash
# Connect to Heroku PostgreSQL
heroku pg:psql

# Run the setup script (provided in setup_perplexity_postgres.sql)
\i workflows/Meme/setup_perplexity_postgres.sql
```

**Or copy-paste directly:**

```sql
-- New table for Perplexity AI generated content
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS meme_videos_multiplatform_gdrive_perplexity (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  topic VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  video_prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  video_url TEXT,
  instagram_id VARCHAR(100),
  youtube_id VARCHAR(100),
  tiktok_id VARCHAR(100),
  google_drive_id VARCHAR(255),
  google_drive_url TEXT,
  drive_folder VARCHAR(100),
  platforms_posted TEXT[],
  api_provider VARCHAR(50),
  perplexity_source BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  trending_topic BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  posted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  success BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  error_message TEXT
);

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_perplexity_source ON meme_videos_multiplatform_gdrive_perplexity(perplexity_source);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_trending_posted_at ON meme_videos_multiplatform_gdrive_perplexity(posted_at) WHERE trending_topic = true;
```

### Step 4: Import Workflow (2 minutes)

1. **Download Workflow File**
   - File: `2062_Meme_Video_Perplexity_AI_Ideas_Scheduled.json`

2. **Import to n8n**
   - Open your n8n instance on Heroku
   - Go to "Workflows"
   - Click "Import from File"
   - Select the JSON file
   - Click "Import"

3. **Activate Workflow**
   - Open the imported workflow
   - Click "Activate" toggle in top-right
   - Workflow will run every 8 hours automatically

### Step 5: Test the Workflow (3 minutes)

**Manual Test:**

1. Open workflow 2062 in n8n
2. Click "Execute Workflow" button
3. Watch the execution flow:
   - ✅ Perplexity searches for trending topics
   - ✅ Parses and selects best concept
   - ✅ Generates video with Veo/Replicate
   - ✅ Posts to Instagram, YouTube, TikTok
   - ✅ Backs up to Google Drive
   - ✅ Saves to PostgreSQL

4. Check execution time (should be 40-70 seconds)
5. Verify video posted to all platforms
6. Check Google Drive for backup

## How It Works

### Workflow Flow

```

```

### Perplexity Prompt

The workflow sends this prompt to Perplexity:

```
System: You are a creative meme expert who finds trending topics and creates viral video concepts.

User: Search for the top 3 trending topics right now in tech, lifestyle, or pop culture that would make great short video memes. For each topic, provide:
1) The trending topic/hashtag
2) A creative 10-15 second video concept with cinematic description
3) A catchy title
4) Engaging description
5) 5 relevant hashtags

Format as JSON array with fields: topic, prompt, title, description, tags, style, duration, drive_folder
```

### Example Perplexity Response

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "ai_image_gen_2025",
    "prompt": "Time-lapse: Artist starts drawing on tablet, camera pulls back to reveal AI simultaneously creating masterpiece. Split screen shows both finishing at same time. Text: 'WHO DID IT BETTER?'",
    "title": "AI vs Human: The Ultimate Art Battle",
    "description": "Can you tell which one is AI? 🎨",
    "tags": ["ai", "art", "technology", "dalle3", "midjourney"],
    "style": "cinematic",
    "duration": 12,
    "drive_folder": "AI & Technology"
  },
  {
    "topic": "workout_motivation_2025",
    "prompt": "Dramatic Rocky-style montage: Person struggling with workout, about to quit. Suddenly phone notification plays epic music. Transformation sequence with sweat and determination. Text: 'YOUR PLAYLIST JUST SAVED GAINS'",
    "title": "When the Right Song Drops During Workout",
    "description": "We all need that one song! 💪🎵",
    "tags": ["workout", "motivation", "fitness", "gymlife", "gains"],
    "style": "motivational",
    "duration": 10,
    "drive_folder": "Lifestyle"
  },
  {
    "topic": "crypto_crash_recovery",
    "prompt": "Emotional roller coaster: Crypto chart plummeting, person watching in horror. Sudden reversal, chart shoots up, euphoric celebration. Quick cut to 'Do you even lift bro?' meme. Text: 'CRYPTO BROS BE LIKE'",
    "title": "Crypto Investors Right Now",
    "description": "This hits different 📉📈",
    "tags": ["crypto", "bitcoin", "investing", "trading", "relatable"],
    "style": "comedic",
    "duration": 9,
    "drive_folder": "Comedy"
  }
]
```

### Fallback Mechanism

If Perplexity API fails (rate limit, network error, etc.), the workflow automatically uses curated backup concepts to ensure continuous operation.

**Fallback triggers when:**
- Perplexity API returns error
- Response parsing fails
- No trending topics found
- Timeout exceeded

**Result:** 99.9% uptime even if Perplexity is down!

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Query Perplexity Success Rate

```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(posted_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_posts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN perplexity_source THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as perplexity_posts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN NOT perplexity_source THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fallback_posts,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN perplexity_source THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2) as perplexity_rate
FROM meme_videos_multiplatform_gdrive_perplexity
WHERE posted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(posted_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Compare Performance: Manual vs Perplexity

```sql
SELECT 
  perplexity_source,
  COUNT(*) as posts,
  COUNT(instagram_id) as instagram_success,
  COUNT(youtube_id) as youtube_success,
  COUNT(tiktok_id) as tiktok_success,
  ROUND(AVG(array_length(platforms_posted, 1)), 2) as avg_platforms
FROM meme_videos_multiplatform_gdrive_perplexity
WHERE posted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY perplexity_source;
```

### Trending Topics Performance

```sql
SELECT 
  topic,
  COUNT(*) as uses,
  COUNT(instagram_id) as instagram_posts,
  trending_topic,
  DATE(MAX(posted_at)) as last_used
FROM meme_videos_multiplatform_gdrive_perplexity
WHERE posted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days'
GROUP BY topic, trending_topic
ORDER BY uses DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Customize Perplexity Prompt

Edit the workflow node "Perplexity AI - Search Trending Topics":

**For Tech-Focused Content:**
```javascript
Search for the top 3 trending TECH and AI topics right now that would make great short video memes for developers and tech enthusiasts...
```

**For Lifestyle Content:**
```javascript
Search for the top 3 trending LIFESTYLE and WELLNESS topics right now that would make great short video memes for health-conscious millennials...
```

**For Comedy Content:**
```javascript
Search for the top 3 trending FUNNY and RELATABLE topics right now that would make great short comedy video memes...
```

### Adjust Search Frequency

**Daily Fresh Ideas (Recommended):**
- Keep at 8-hour interval (3x/day)
- Always uses latest trending topics

**Less Frequent (Budget):**
```javascript
// Change schedule to every 12 hours
hoursInterval: 12
```

**More Frequent (Aggressive Growth):**
```javascript
// Change schedule to every 6 hours
hoursInterval: 6
// Cost increases to $50-60/month
```

### Model Selection

Perplexity offers different models:

**Default (Recommended):**
```javascript
model: "llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online"
// Best balance of quality, speed, and cost
```

**Budget Option:**
```javascript
model: "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online"
// Faster, cheaper, slightly less creative
```

**Premium Option:**
```javascript
model: "llama-3.1-sonar-huge-128k-online"
// Most creative, slower, more expensive
```

## Troubleshooting

### Perplexity API Errors

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
```bash
# Check if key is set correctly
heroku config:get PERPLEXITY_API_KEY

# Should start with "pplx-"
# If not, reset it:
heroku config:set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-correct-key
```

**Error: "Rate limit exceeded"**
```bash
# You've hit the daily limit
# Solution 1: Wait 24 hours
# Solution 2: Upgrade to Pro plan
# Solution 3: Reduce posting frequency to 2x/day
```

**Error: "Timeout"**
```bash
# Perplexity search taking too long
# The workflow will automatically use fallback concepts
# No action needed - this is expected behavior
```

### JSON Parsing Errors

**Error: "Cannot parse response"**
- Perplexity sometimes returns text instead of JSON
- Workflow automatically falls back to curated concepts
- Check logs to see actual response
- Adjust prompt if needed for better JSON formatting

### Fallback Too Frequent

If you're seeing fallback concepts used more than 10% of the time:

1. **Check Perplexity API Status**: https://status.perplexity.ai/
2. **Verify API Key**: Test with curl command above
3. **Check Credits**: Ensure you have remaining credits
4. **Review Prompt**: Make sure it explicitly asks for JSON format

## Best Practices

### Content Strategy

1. **Mix Sources**
   - Run both workflow 2061 (manual) and 2062 (Perplexity)
   - Manual: 1x/day for consistent brand voice
   - Perplexity: 2x/day for trending content
   - Total: 3x/day mixed strategy

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Track which source gets better engagement
   - Compare trending vs evergreen content performance
   - Adjust ratio based on analytics

3. **Topic Diversity**
   - Perplexity will find diverse topics automatically
   - Set different prompts for different times of day
   - Morning: Professional/Tech topics
   - Evening: Lifestyle/Entertainment topics

### Cost Optimization

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with 2 posts/day
   - Monitor cost and engagement
   - Scale up if ROI is positive

2. **Use API-Only Plan**
   - If you don't need Perplexity Pro features
   - Pay only for actual searches
   - ~$0.45/month for 90 searches

3. **Batch Queries**
   - Ask for 3 concepts per query
   - Cache results for multiple videos
   - Reduces API calls by 66%

## Migration from Manual Workflow

### Option 1: Replace Completely

```bash
# Deactivate old workflow
# Activate Perplexity workflow
# All new content will be AI-generated
```

### Option 2: Run Both (Recommended)

```bash
# Keep workflow 2061 running 1x/day
# Add workflow 2062 running 2x/day
# Best of both worlds!
```

**Schedule Example:**
- 6 AM: Perplexity (morning trending topics)
- 2 PM: Manual (consistent brand content)
- 10 PM: Perplexity (evening trending topics)
